## TODO
* check if using alternatives to CPS can be effective (like returning
  an array) can be used to achieve higher performance
* in expressions invent something better to pass parameters to the 
  expr parser 
* implement regular expressions to create fsm that can run in fixed
  space time (use loop-recur)
